AIRBNB CLONE V2 PROJECT

2. Update the def do_create(self, arg): function of your command interpreter (console.py) to allow for object creation with given parameters:

Command syntax: create <Class name> <param 1> <param 2> <param 3>...
Param syntax: <key name>=<value>
Value syntax:
String: "<value>" => starts with a double quote
any double quote inside the value must be escaped with a backslash \
all underscores _ must be replace by spaces . Example: You want to set the string My little house to the attribute name, your command line must be name="My_little_house"
Float: <unit>.<decimal> => contains a dot .
Integer: <number> => default case
If any parameter doesn’t fit with these requirements or can’t be recognized correctly by your program, it must be skipped
Don’t forget to add tests for this new feature!

Also, this new feature will be tested here only with FileStorage engine.

3. a script that prepares a MySQL server for the project:

A database hbnb_dev_db
A new user hbnb_dev (in localhost)
The password of hbnb_dev should be set to hbnb_dev_pwd
hbnb_dev should have all privileges on the database hbnb_dev_db (and only this database)
hbnb_dev should have SELECT privilege on the database performance_schema (and only this database)
If the database hbnb_dev_db or the user hbnb_dev already exists, your script should not fail

4. a script that prepares a MySQL server for the project:

A database hbnb_test_db
A new user hbnb_test (in localhost)
The password of hbnb_test should be set to hbnb_test_pwd
hbnb_test should have all privileges on the database hbnb_test_db (and only this database)
hbnb_test should have SELECT privilege on the database performance_schema (and only this database)
If the database hbnb_test_db or the user hbnb_test already exists, your script should not fail

5. Update FileStorage: (models/engine/file_storage.py)

Add a new public instance method: def delete(self, obj=None): to delete obj from __objects if it’s inside - if obj is equal to None, the method should not do anything
Update the prototype of def all(self) to def all(self, cls=None) - that returns the list of objects of one type of class. Example below with State - it’s an optional filtering

6. SQLAlchemy will be your best friend!

It’s time to change your storage engine and use SQLAlchemy TASK.

7. Update User: (models/user.py)

User inherits from BaseModel and Base (respect the order)
Add or replace in the class User:
class attribute __tablename__
represents the table name, users
class attribute email
represents a column containing a string (128 characters)
can’t be null
class attribute password
represents a column containing a string (128 characters)
can’t be null
class attribute first_name
represents a column containing a string (128 characters)
can be null
class attribute last_name
represents a column containing a string (128 characters)
can be null

8. Update Place: (models/place.py)

Place inherits from BaseModel and Base (respect the order)
Add or replace in the class Place:
class attribute __tablename__
represents the table name, places
class attribute city_id
represents a column containing a string (60 characters)
can’t be null
is a foreign key to cities.id
class attribute user_id
represents a column containing a string (60 characters)
can’t be null
is a foreign key to users.id
class attribute name
represents a column containing a string (128 characters)
can’t be null
class attribute description
represents a column containing a string (1024 characters)
can be null
class attribute number_rooms
represents a column containing an integer
can’t be null
default value: 0
class attribute number_bathrooms
represents a column containing an integer
can’t be null
default value: 0
class attribute max_guest
represents a column containing an integer
can’t be null
default value: 0
class attribute price_by_night
represents a column containing an integer
can’t be null
default value: 0
class attribute latitude
represents a column containing a float
can be null
class attribute longitude
represents a column containing a float
can be null
Update User: (models/user.py)

Add or replace in the class User:
class attribute places must represent a relationship with the class Place. If the User object is deleted, all linked Place objects must be automatically deleted. Also, the reference from a Place object to his User should be named user
Update City: (models/city.py)

Add or replace in the class City:
class attribute places must represent a relationship with the class Place. If the City object is deleted, all linked Place objects must be automatically deleted. Also, the reference from a Place object to his City should be named cities

9. Update Review: (models/review.py)

Review inherits from BaseModel and Base (respect the order)
Add or replace in the class Review:
class attribute __tablename__
represents the table name, reviews
class attribute text
represents a column containing a string (1024 characters)
can’t be null
class attribute place_id
represents a column containing a string (60 characters)
can’t be null
is a foreign key to places.id
class attribute user_id
represents a column containing a string (60 characters)
can’t be null
is a foreign key to users.id
Update User: (models/user.py)

Add or replace in the class User:
class attribute reviews must represent a relationship with the class Review. If the User object is deleted, all linked Review objects must be automatically deleted. Also, the reference from a Review object to his User should be named user
Update Place: (models/place.py)

for DBStorage: class attribute reviews must represent a relationship with the class Review. If the Place object is deleted, all linked Review objects must be automatically deleted. Also, the reference from a Review object to his Place should be named place
for FileStorage: getter attribute reviews that returns the list of Review instances with place_id equals to the current Place.id => It will be the FileStorage relationship between Place and Review

10. Update Amenity: (models/amenity.py)

Amenity inherits from BaseModel and Base (respect the order)
Add or replace in the class Amenity:
class attribute __tablename__
represents the table name, amenities
class attribute name
represents a column containing a string (128 characters)
can’t be null
class attribute place_amenities must represent a relationship Many-To-Many between the class Place and Amenity. Please see below more detail: place_amenity in the Place update
Update Place: (models/place.py)

Add an instance of SQLAlchemy Table called place_amenity for creating the relationship Many-To-Many between Place and Amenity:
table name place_amenity
metadata = Base.metadata
2 columns:
place_id, a string of 60 characters foreign key of places.id, primary key in the table and never null
amenity_id, a string of 60 characters foreign key of amenities.id, primary key in the table and never null
Update Place class:
for DBStorage: class attribute amenities must represent a relationship with the class Amenity but also as secondary to place_amenity with option viewonly=False (place_amenity has been define previously)
for FileStorage:
Getter attribute amenities that returns the list of Amenity instances based on the attribute amenity_ids that contains all Amenity.id linked to the Place
Setter attribute amenities that handles append method for adding an Amenity.id to the attribute amenity_ids. This method should accept only Amenity object, otherwise, do nothing.
What’s a Many-to-Many relationship?
In our system, we don’t want to duplicate amenities (for example, having 10000 time the amenity Wifi), so they will be unique. But, at least 2 places can have the same amenity (like Wifi for example). We are in the case of:

an amenity can be linked to multiple places
a place can have multiple amenities
= Many-To-Many

To make this link working, we will create a third table called place_amenity that will create these links.

And you are good, you have a new engine!




<center> <h1>HBNB - The Console</h1> </center>

This repository contains the initial stage of a student project to build a clone of the AirBnB website. This stage implements a backend interface, or console, to manage program data. Console commands allow the user to create, update, and destroy objects, as well as manage file storage. Using a system of JSON serialization/deserialization, storage is persistent between sessions.

<center> <h2>General Use</h2> </center>

1. First clone this repository.

3. Once the repository is cloned locate the "console.py" file and run it as follows:
```
/AirBnB_clone$ ./console.py
```
4. When this command is run the following prompt should appear:
```
(hbnb)
```
5. This prompt designates you are in the "HBnB" console. There are a variety of commands available within the console program.

##### Commands
    * create - Creates an instance based on given class

    * destroy - Destroys an object based on class and UUID

    * show - Shows an object based on class and UUID

    * all - Shows all objects the program has access to, or all objects of a given class

    * update - Updates existing attributes an object based on class name and UUID

    * quit - Exits the program (EOF will as well)


##### Alternative Syntax
Users are able to issue a number of console command using an alternative syntax:

	Usage: <class_name>.<command>([<id>[name_arg value_arg]|[kwargs]])
Advanced syntax is implemented for the following commands: 

    * all - Shows all objects the program has access to, or all objects of a given class

	* count - Return number of object instances by class

    * show - Shows an object based on class and UUID

	* destroy - Destroys an object based on class and UUID

    * update - Updates existing attributes an object based on class name and UUID
